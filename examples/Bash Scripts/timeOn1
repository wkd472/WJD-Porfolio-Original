#       This script will ask the user for a user prefix
#       If the prefix is not a valid it will display an error then exit
#       with error code 2.
#       If the prefix is valid but not logged in it will display that info
#       and exit with error code 1
#       If the prefix is valid and logged in it will display the related user info
#       including the user name, terminal and time logged in to the system
#       it will then exit with error code 0. I will list this information for
#	all of the users logged in with that prefix.
